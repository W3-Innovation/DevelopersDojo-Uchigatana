### <i style="color: #DE1242">About Developers Dojo</i>

<hr style="border: none; background: #B50C40; height: 1px;">

<p style="min-width: 610px; max-width: 790px;">To explain Seppuku, I must first explain Developer’s Dojo. Developer's Dojo is a collection of themes that am currently developing. The collection consist of 3 Themes in all. Below this paragraph, I have listed all three themes. As of writing this, (March 2021) Suppuku is the only theme, of the three, to get published. Since all the themes have the same layout, share a syntax/semantics color-scheme, and are already partially developed, they too should release fairly soon.</p>

_The entire Developer's Dojo collection, once released, will be as follows:_

1. Developer’s Dojo: Seppuku
1. Developer’s Dojo: Bushido
1. Developer’s Dojo: Uchigatana

### <i style="color: #DE1242">About Seppuku</i>

<hr style="border: none; background: #B50C40; height: 1px;">

<p style="min-width: 610px; max-width: 790px;">Seppuku is a dark theme that has a quintessential bichromatic pallete that is foundation of its entire design. All the color/shades used in the theme to style, and color the editor, were derived from the bichromatic pallete. Bellow I list the 3 colors that make up the pallete. (There are 3 colors, but black is nuetral, where the other two colors are compliments of each other, that is why, even though it has three colors, it is still considered bichromatic.)</p>

**Quintessential Bichromatic Pallete:**

<br>

<b style="font-size: 14px; color: #FFFFFF; padding: 11px 28px; background: #FF0840; border: 2px solid #FFFFFF;">CRIMSON</b> &nbsp; &nbsp;
<b style="font-size: 14px; color: #00FF6A; padding: 11px 34px; background: #000004; border: 2px solid #00FF6A;"> BLACK </b> &nbsp; &nbsp;
<b style="font-size: 14px; color: #D00040; padding: 11px 14px; background: #12FF7A; border: 3px solid #D00040;">MALACHITE</b> &nbsp; &nbsp;

<br>

<p style="min-width: 610px; max-width: 790px;">I tried styling the black so you could see it, but if your readme documents use a dark background it matbe hard. The black is more of a Gunmetal-black/Charcoal-black, it uses blue as the dominant color, and even adds a couple green points over red. I found that the color I chose for the black was what made the theme most unique. AYU uses a similar color of black, however, even though Seppuku is dark, it is far from AYU. I think most people would refer to this theme, when speaking in a general sense, as being a red and black theme, which is not entirley accurate but it does paint a picture thats close to the truth.</p>

### <i style="color: #DE1242">Suppuku-Documentation & VSCode-Features</i>

<hr style="border: none; background: #B50C40; height: 1px;">

<p style="min-width: 610px; max-width: 790px;">I documented and categorized pretty much all of the colors used by Seppuku, which took a lot of painstaking time, but doing so awarded me with the ability to create documentation for the Seppuku user. Having documentation for any computer science technology, even an editor/IDE theme, is important, honestly what I just said, should go without even having to say it. The point I am making here, and maybe I am on a bit of a tangent, but the point is; every theme varies in color, not a little bit, but alotta-bit. When it comes to open-source editor themes there is little to no consistency in editor highlighting color definitions, let me give you an example. A theme I really like, Ayu, uses yellow-green to display errors &/or warnings (Im not sure if it is one or both), however other themes that I had switched to after using Ayu used various shades of red and/or yellow to highlight the same errors/problems. Becuase of the tendancy for themes to vary in the shades used for highlighting, I feel any good theme will responsibly offer some sort of documentation to clearly state at a minimum, what collors they assigned to statuses, (by statuses I mean, error, warning, info, invalid, autofix, & lightbulb). I do want do close this section stating that I understand that there is good reason for themes not documenting the colors the use, <u><b>it takes forever, </b></u>a lot more time then perhaps it is worth, the value of such a thing is subject to opinion. To me it seems like it's my duty, as a developer, to offer proper documentation, even for a theme, which is why there is more documentation than you probably care to read below, but if you do need to know what a color is trying to cominucate, or why somthing is being highlighted, when you use seppuku, you have a referance to help you find the answer.</p>

### <i style="color: #DE1242;">Choose a Theme That Supports VSCode's Latest & Greatest</i>

<hr style="border: none; background: #BB0B3B; height: 1px;">

<p style="min-width: 610px; max-width: 790px;">I devoted a good amount of time to the configuring/coloring of properties used by much of VSCodes new, and more contemporary features. Some of the properties include, semanticTokens and gitDecorations. The two propertie groups I just named style code syntax in a way that VSCode wasn't able to before, and TabDecorations, which quite honestly enhances the asthetic beauty of the editor so much, that it looks more modern than many of its paid-for competitors, like JetBrains IDEs, or its evil, Windows only twin, the Visual Studios IDE (not paid for, comes with windows). I have used all of the above editors, and as a student have had unlimeted access to JetBrains overpriced suit for sometime. VSCode was not better than JetBrains products when it released 5 years ago, but over the last five years, it has really come out with alot of innovation, and I love how it is built using Node.js. With all that said, alot of the features design, look and layout are contingant on the styling of the theme that the editor has equiped at any given time. One of the major points I am making here is that most themes, if I had to guess I would say 85%-90%, have deprecated properties/TextMate-Tokens in there JSON file. Some have so much, that when I open them the entire page highlights yellow. A good argument could be made that the theme is the most important extention that a developer has to make a choice on, whether you agree with that statment or not, when you look at a theme created by an experianced theme developer, versus one of the old thems thats been around for 3years + now, the differances are clear. Whether you like Seppuku, or one of my other themes, or you perfer somthing else, you should always make sure you are using a theme that is either new, or being updated regularly. If you don't like my themes, I am putting together a list on my github page that you can check out, the link is at the top of this README.md file. </p>
